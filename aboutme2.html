    <h1>MUSIC</h1>
<p><b>What is music?</b> <br>
    Music is the vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.
    Everything you hear around you is a form of music. But, don’t mistake <b>noise</b> for music. Music is meant to sound good, so when you combine different noises together to form sounds that are pleasing to the ear, you’ve created music!
    </p>
    
    <p>There are many genres of music. A few examples are as follows:</p>

   <p>  Pop
   </br> Rock
</br>Jazz
</br>   R&B
</br>   World
</br>   Musical Theatre
</br>   Folk Music
</br>   And many more.

          <b>POP MUSIC</b>
            Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. A hit is a song that sells many copies, and the latest hits 
            are listed every week on the charts. They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to remember and sing along to. 
            Pop songs are not necessarily *produced* by pop artists. Artists who sing R&B, soul music, country music, and rappers are also 
            pop music artists. 
            <i>Ariana Grande, Pharell Williams, Katy Perry, Adele, Khalid, and Eminem, Whitney Houston</i> are a few famous pop music artists. 
            Listen to a few of their hit songs, and you’ll know what I mean! You’ll love them. <br> 
        </br><b>*FUN FACT!</b> : Michael Jackson and Madonna are respectively known as the <b>King</b> and <b>Queen</b> of <b>Pop.</b>
